                    Beyond coding, I have a few hobbies that keep me energized and inspired. I'm an avid gamer with a high-end gaming PC, and I've been exploring PC games since my childhood. No matter the genre, I enjoy immersing myself in virtual worlds.

                Hello! I'm a passionate Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in web development. Currently, I'm diving into the world of full-stack web development, honing my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. Among all the tools and technologies, CSS is my absolute favorite, as it lets me express my creativity through stunning designs and animations.

                    When I'm not gaming, you'll probably find me at the gym, as I'm equally passionate about fitness. Staying active and pushing my limits in both gaming and gym sessions is part of who I am.
